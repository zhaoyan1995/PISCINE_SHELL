An original file called file1.txt
Hello, World!
This is the original file.

A patch file called update.patch that contains changes you want to apply to file1.txt
2c2
< This is the original file.
---
> This is the modified file.

This update.patch file indicates a change in line2 of file 1.txt

Applying the Patch with -o

If you want to apply update.patch to file1.txt but sae the result to a new file called file2.txt, without modifying file1.txt directly, you can use 

patch file1.txt update.patch -o file2.txt
After running this command:
file1.txt remains unchanged
file2.txt will be created with the updated content:
Hello, World!
This is the modified file.

This example shows how the -o option lets you keep the original file intact while saving the patchedd result to a different file.
