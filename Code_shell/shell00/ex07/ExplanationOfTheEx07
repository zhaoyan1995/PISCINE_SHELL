we create a file named "a"
we type some texte in this file.
we save it and quit this file.
we use the commande line below:
diff a b >sw.diff
patch a sw.diff -o b
it shows: "patching file b(read from a)

In the patch command, the -o option spedifies an output file where the patched content should be written. This option is useful if you want to apply changes from a patch files to a source file but save the modified resulta to a new file, leaving the original file unchanged

syntax:
patch proginal_file  patch file -o output_file 

In this example, a is the original file,
sw.diff is the patch file
-o b means the result (patched content) will be saved to a new file b without modifying the original file a

This is especially useful when you want to review changes without altering the original file directly.
