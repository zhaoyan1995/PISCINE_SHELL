Suppose you have an original file called file.txt with the following content:
Hello,World !
This is the original file.

You also have a modified file called file_modified.txt with this ocntent:
Hello, World !
This is the modified file.

We want to create a patch file to recored the difference between file.txt and file_modified.txt, and then apply that patch to file.txt to update its content.

Step 1, creat the Patch File
diff -u file.txt file_modified.txt > update.patch

This update.patch file captures the change needed to turn file.txt into file_modified.txt

Step2 Apply the Patch
Now let's apply update.patch to file.txt:
patch file.txt < update.patch
After running thes command, file.txt will be updated with the changes from update.patch

The content of file.txt is now :
Hello, world !
This is the modified file.
